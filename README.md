PUBHLTH460 - Telling Stories with Data- Statistics, Modeling, and Visualization

Fall 2019

According to the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an average of 553,000
people in America experienced homelessness on any given night in 2018. To add onto this concerning 
statistic, according to endhomelessness.org, in 2017 in the United States alone, more than 40 million 
people were living in poverty and 18.5 million were living in deep poverty and at risk of becoming
homeless. Over the years, the number of homeless in the United States has been growing. In fact, 
the number of homeless people on a single on a single night increased by 0.3 between 2017 and 2018.
Looking more in depth into our state, in Massachusetts in 2018, it was reported that there was a 
total homeless population of 20,068 (this means that 29 out of every 10,000 people are experiencing)
homelessness. This was a significant 14.2% jump from 2017 and a 20.6% increase from 2010. Overall, 
as we continually move into the future, homelessness is continually on the rise and is more prominent
and relevant than ever.

Using the Homelessness dataset given to us through 
[ThisIsStatistics](https://thisisstatistics.org/falldatachallenge/), our group is hoping to 
analyze homeless data and come up with insights that may shed better light on the state of homeless 
in Massachusetts as well as the general country.
